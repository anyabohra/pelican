# Install Pelican on macOS

This document explains how to install Pelican on macOS.

## Install Pelican as a standalone binary

Pelican provides a binary file instead of a `DMG` installer for macOS. You need to download and extract the binary and add the binary to your `PATH` environment variable.

1. Navigate to [Pelican download page](../install.mdx#download-pelican-binary) and select the Pelican macOS binary you want to install.

2. In the **Operating System** section, select **macOS**. In **Architectures** section, select **X86_64** or **ARM64** depending on the architecture of your machine.

3. In the list of candidates, copy the link to `pelican_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz` if you select **X86_64**, or `pelican_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz` if you select **ARM64**.

4. Change the following command with the link to the binary you copied in the previous step and run the command:

    ```bash
    wget <replace-with-the-link-you-copied>
    tar -zxvf pelican_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz // ARM user
    ```

    Note that you need to replace `pelican_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz` with `pelican_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz` if you are running an X86 machine.

    Example to install Pelican binary for an ARM machine:

    ```bash
    curl -O https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican/releases/download/v7.5.8/pelican_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf pelican_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz
    ```

5. The above command extracted the binary from the tar file. You may run the binary in the current folder, but it is recommended that you add Pelican binary to your `PATH` environment variable to allow `pelican` to be called directly from your command line. To run Pelican binary from the download folder:

    ```bash
    $ cd pelican_Darwin_arm64 # Go to the binary folder
    $ ./pelican --version # Run Pelican binary

## Add Pelican binary to your `PATH`

  * Add Pelican binary to your `PATH` for the current terminal

    ```bash
    $ cd pelican_Darwin_arm64 # Go to the binary folder
    $ export PATH=$PWD:$PATH # Add current folder to the PATH
    $ pelican --version # Run Pelican binary

  * Add Pelican binary to your `PATH` permanently

    ```bash
    $ cd pelican_Darwin_arm64 # Go to the binary folder
    $ echo "export PATH=$PWD:\$PATH" >> ~/.zshrc # Add the current folder to your .zshrc file
    $ source ~/.zshrc # Apply the change
    $ pelican --version # Run Pelican binary

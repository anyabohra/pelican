# Install Pelican as a standalone binary on Linux

This document explains how to install Pelican on a Linux operating system as a standalone binary.

## Download Pelican Binary

1. Navigate to [Pelican download page](../install.mdx#download-pelican-binary) and select the Pelican standalone binary you want to install.

2. In **Operating System** section, select **Linux**. In **Architectures** section, select **X86_64** or **AMR64** depending on the architecture of your machine.

3. In the list of candidates, copy the link to `pelican_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz` if you select **X86_64**, or `pelican_Linux_arm64.tar.gz` if you select **ARM64**.

4. Change the following command with the link to the binary you copied in the previous step and run the command

    ```bash
    wget <replace-with-the-link-you-copied>
    tar -zxvf pelican_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz # x86_64 user
    ```

    > **Note**: You need to replace `pelican_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz` with `pelican_Linux_arm64.tar.gz` if you are running an `ARM64` machine.

    Example to install Pelican standalone binary on an `X86_64` machine:

    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican/releases/download/v7.5.8/pelican_Linux_arm64.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf pelican_Linux_arm64.tar.gz
    ```

## Add Pelican Binary to `PATH`

The above command extracted the binary from the `tar` file. You may run the binary in the current folder, but it is recommended that you add Pelican binary to your `PATH` environment variable to allow `pelican` to be called directly from your command line.

### Run Pelican binary from the downloaded folder:

```bash
$ cd pelican_Linux_arm64 # Go to the binary folder
$ ./pelican --version # Run Pelican binary
